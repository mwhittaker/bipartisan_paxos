\begin{abstract}
  In this paper, we present a family of state machine replication protocols
  inspired by Fast Paxos~\cite{lamport2006fast}, EPaxos~\cite{moraru2013there},
  and Caesar~\cite{arun2017speeding}. The protocols are called Bipartisan
  Paxos, Unanimous Bipartisan Paxos, Deadlock Bipartisan Paxos, and Majority
  Commit Bipartisan Paxos.
