  \Large EPaxos Bug
\end{center}

In this document, we outline a minor bug in Basic EPaxos~\cite{moraru2013there,
moraru2013proof}. In short, Basic EPaxos does not implement ballots correctly,
and this can lead to two different triples $(\gamma, seq_\gamma, deps_\gamma)$
being chosen in the same instance. Throughout the document, we assume a very
strong familiarity with EPaxos.

\section{Paxos Ballots}
In Paxos~\cite{lamport1998part}, every acceptor maintains three pieces of
state:
\newcommand{\voteBallot}{vote\_ballot}
\newcommand{\voteValue}{vote\_value}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{ballot}:
    the largest ballot (a.k.a.\ round) that the acceptor knows about.

  \item \textbf{\voteBallot{}}:
    the largest ballot in which the acceptor has voted for a value, or $-1$ if
    the acceptor has not yet voted.

  \item \textbf{\voteValue{}}:
    the value voted for in \voteBallot{}, or $\bot$ if vote\_ballot is $-1$.
\end{itemize}
Note that every acceptor maintains \emph{two} different ballots: one that is
updated whenever an acceptor hears about a larger ballot and one that is only
updated when the acceptor votes. Having two different ballots is critical for
maintaining Paxos' correctness. We'll see momentarily that EPaxos replicas
maintain only a single ballot! This is the root of the bug.

\section{Basic EPaxos Ballots}
It is unclear exactly how Basic EPaxos implements ballots. The EPaxos
paper~\cite{moraru2013proof} elides many of the details.\footnote{For good
reason!  Ballots are not really the core part of the protocol, and eliding them
makes the protocol much easier to understand.} For example, the authors say
``for simplicity, we represent [ballots] explicitly in our pseudocode only when
describing the Explicit Prepare phase in Figure 3.''

\newcommand{\largestBallot}{\textit{largest\_ballot}}
\newcommand{\cmd}{\textit{cmd}}
Reading through EPaxos' \TLAplus{} specification~\cite{moraru2013proof} and
implementation\footnote{\url{https://github.com/efficient/epaxos}}, here's our
best guess as to how Basic EPaxos implements ballots. Every Basic EPaxos
replica maintains a single ballot \largestBallot{}, the largest ballot that the
replica has ever seen. Moreover, every \cmd{} log entry $\cmd[Q][i]$ maintains
a single ballot $b_{Q.i}$. Whenever a replica sends a PreAccept, Accept, or
Prepare message to other replicas, it includes a ballot in the message.
Initially, the leader of the instance sets its ballot to $0$. During recovery,
a replica sets its ballot to one larger than \largestBallot{} and increments
\largestBallot{}. Whenever a replica receives a PreAccept, Accept, or Prepare
message for instance $Q.i$, it does the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    If the message's ballot is smaller than $b_{Q.i}$, the replica ignores the
    message (or sends a nack).
  \item
    Otherwise, if the message's ballot is not smaller than $b_{Q.i}$, then the
    replica updates $b_{Q.i}$ to the ballot in the message.
\end{itemize}
If a replica receives a nack, it updates \largestBallot{} accordingly.

\section{The Bug}
Because Basic EPaxos only maintains a single ballot $b_{Q.i}$ for every
instance---instead of two, like Paxos does---it's possible that two different
triples $(\gamma, seq_\gamma, deps_\gamma)$ can be chosen in the same instance.
Here's an execution with five replicas, $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$, showing how
this can happen. For every step of the execution, we show the state at each
replica. We omit sequence numbers because they are not relevant here.

\newcommand{\preaccepted}{\textbf{pre-accepted}}
\newcommand{\accepted}{\textbf{accepted}}
\newcommand{\committed}{\textbf{committed}}
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Initially, all five replicas have an empty command log.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $A$: empty \cmd{} log
      \item $B$: empty \cmd{} log
      \item $C$: empty \cmd{} log
      \item $D$: empty \cmd{} log
      \item $E$: empty \cmd{} log
    \end{itemize}

  \item
    $E$ receives command $\gamma$ and assigns it instance $E.0$. It pre-accepts
    it and sends PreAccept messages to the other replicas. $C$ and $D$ receive
    the PreAccept messages, but the messages sent to $A$ and $B$ are delayed.
    We show the command, dependencies, status, and ballot below.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $A$: empty \cmd{} log
      \item $B$: empty \cmd{} log
      \item $C$: $(\gamma, \emptyset{}, \preaccepted{}, 0.E)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $D$: $(\gamma, \emptyset{}, \preaccepted{}, 0.E)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $E$: $(\gamma, \emptyset{}, \preaccepted{}, 0.E)$ in instance $E.0$
    \end{itemize}

  \item
    $E$ receives PreAcceptOk messages from $C$ and $D$. After a timeout, it
    takes the slow path and accepts $\gamma$. It sends Accept messages to other
    replicas, but all these messages are dropped.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $A$: empty \cmd{} log
      \item $B$: empty \cmd{} log
      \item $C$: $(\gamma, \emptyset{}, \preaccepted{}, 0.E)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $D$: $(\gamma, \emptyset{}, \preaccepted{}, 0.E)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $E$: $(\gamma, \emptyset{}, \accepted{}, 0.E)$ in instance $E.0$
    \end{itemize}

  \item
    $A$ receives command $\beta$ that conflicts with $\gamma$. It pre-accepts
    $\beta$ and sends PreAccept messages, but all these messages are dropped.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $A$: $(\beta, \emptyset{}, \preaccepted{}, 0.A)$ in instance $A.0$
      \item $B$: empty \cmd{} log
      \item $C$: $(\gamma, \emptyset{}, \preaccepted{}, 0.E)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $D$: $(\gamma, \emptyset{}, \preaccepted{}, 0.E)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $E$: $(\gamma, \emptyset{}, \accepted{}, 0.E)$ in instance $E.0$
    \end{itemize}

  \item
    $A$ receives the PreAccept command from $E$.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $A$: $(\beta, \emptyset{}, \preaccepted{}, 0.A)$ in instance $A.0$;
                 $(\gamma, \set{\beta}, \preaccepted{}, 0.E)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $B$: empty \cmd{} log
      \item $C$: $(\gamma, \emptyset{}, \preaccepted{}, 0.E)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $D$: $(\gamma, \emptyset{}, \preaccepted{}, 0.E)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $E$: $(\gamma, \emptyset{}, \accepted{}, 0.E)$ in instance $E.0$
    \end{itemize}

  \item
    $A$ begins to recover instance $E.0$ in ballot $1.A$. It sends Prepare
    messages to $A$, $B$, and $C$. $A$, $B$, and $C$ process the Prepare and
    reply back. $A$ does not receive a committed or accepted response. It also
    does not receive at least $\floor{N/2}$ identical replies for the default
    ballot. It does receive a pre-accepted response, so it takes the slow path
    to choose $\gamma$. It pre-accepts $\gamma$ and sends PreAccept messages to
    the other replicas.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $A$: $(\beta, \emptyset{}, \preaccepted{}, 0.A)$ in instance $A.0$;
                 $(\gamma, \set{\beta}, \preaccepted{}, 1.A)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $B$: empty \cmd{} log
      \item $C$: $(\gamma, \emptyset{}, \preaccepted{}, 1.A)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $D$: $(\gamma, \emptyset{}, \preaccepted{}, 0.E)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $E$: $(\gamma, \emptyset{}, \accepted{}, 0.E)$ in instance $E.0$
    \end{itemize}

  \item
    $B$ and $C$ receive the PreAccept messages and reply to $A$. $A$ takes the
    slow path, and sends out Accepts.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $A$: $(\beta, \emptyset{}, \preaccepted{}, 0.A)$ in instance $A.0$;
                 $(\gamma, \set{\beta}, \preaccepted{}, 1.A)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $B$: $(\gamma, \set{\beta}, \preaccepted{}, 1.A)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $C$: $(\gamma, \set{\beta}, \preaccepted{}, 1.A)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $D$: $(\gamma, \emptyset{}, \preaccepted{}, 0.E)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $E$: $(\gamma, \emptyset{}, \accepted{}, 0.E)$ in instance $E.0$
    \end{itemize}

  \item
    $A$, $B$, and $C$ receive the Accepts and reply to $A$.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $A$: $(\beta, \emptyset{}, \preaccepted{}, 0.A)$ in instance $A.0$;
                 $(\gamma, \set{\beta}, \accepted{}, 1.A)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $B$: $(\gamma, \set{\beta}, \accepted{}, 1.A)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $C$: $(\gamma, \set{\beta}, \accepted{}, 1.A)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $D$: $(\gamma, \emptyset{}, \preaccepted{}, 0.E)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $E$: $(\gamma, \emptyset{}, \accepted{}, 0.E)$ in instance $E.0$
    \end{itemize}

  \item
    $A$ receives the Accepts, and commits $\gamma$ with dependencies
    $\set{\beta}$. It sends out Commit messages, but they are lost.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $A$: $(\beta, \emptyset{}, \preaccepted{}, 0.A)$ in instance $A.0$;
                 $(\gamma, \set{\beta}, \committed{}, 1.A)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $B$: $(\gamma, \set{\beta}, \accepted{}, 1.A)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $C$: $(\gamma, \set{\beta}, \accepted{}, 1.A)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $D$: $(\gamma, \emptyset{}, \preaccepted{}, 0.E)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $E$: $(\gamma, \emptyset{}, \accepted{}, 0.E)$ in instance $E.0$
    \end{itemize}

  \item
    $B$ begins recovery for instance $E.0$ in ballot $2.B$. It sends Prepares
    that are received by $C$, $D$, and $E$. The critical bug here is that when
    $C$, $D$, and $E$ process the Prepare, they increment their ballots even
    though they shouldn't.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $A$: $(\beta, \emptyset{}, \preaccepted{}, 0.A)$ in instance $A.0$;
                 $(\gamma, \set{\beta}, \committed{}, 1.A)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $B$: $(\gamma, \set{\beta}, \accepted{}, 1.A)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $C$: $(\gamma, \set{\beta}, \accepted{}, 2.B)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $D$: $(\gamma, \emptyset{}, \preaccepted{}, 2.B)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $E$: $(\gamma, \emptyset{}, \accepted{}, 2.B)$ in instance $E.0$
    \end{itemize}

  \item
    $C$ begins recovery for instance $E.0$ in ballot $3.C$. It sends Prepares
    that are received by $C$, $D$, and $E$. It receives an accepted reply, so
    by line 30 of Figure 3 of the EPaxos paper, it runs the Paxos accept phase.
    The bug here is that it receives two different accepted replies: one with
    dependencies $\emptyset$ and one with dependencies $\set{\beta}$. The
    algorithm is written assuming there can only be a single unique reply, but
    here we have two. $C$ goes with the empty dependencies and proposes it in
    the Paxos accept phase. The value gets chosen. This is a bug. Two different
    dependencies were chosen for the same instance.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $A$: $(\beta, \emptyset{}, \preaccepted{}, 0.A)$ in instance $A.0$;
                 $(\gamma, \set{\beta}, \committed{}, 1.A)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $B$: $(\gamma, \set{\beta}, \accepted{}, 1.A)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $C$: $(\gamma, \emptyset{}, \committed{}, 3.C)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $D$: $(\gamma, \emptyset{}, \accepted{}, 3.C)$ in instance $E.0$
      \item $E$: $(\gamma, \emptyset{}, \accepted{}, 3.C)$ in instance $E.0$
    \end{itemize}
