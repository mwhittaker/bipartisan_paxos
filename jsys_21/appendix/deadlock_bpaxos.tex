\subsection{Pruned Dependencies}\appendixlabel{PrunedDependencies}
Here, we prove that \invref{DependencyService} and \invref{PrunedDependencies}
imply \invref{ConflictInvariant}.
%
Consider two conflicting commands $x$ and $y$ chosen in instances $I_x$ and
$I_y$. $x$ and $y$ conflict, so neither is $\noop$. Thus, by
\invref{PrunedDependencies}, $I_x$ is chosen with pruned dependencies
$\deps{I_x} - P_x$ and $I_y$ is chosen with pruned dependencies $\deps{I_y} -
P_y$ derived from dependencies $\deps{I_x}$ and $\deps{I_y}$ computed by the
dependency service. We want to show that $I_x \in \deps{I_y} - P_y$ or $I_y \in
\deps{I_x} - P_x$, or both.
%
By \invref{DependencyService}, either $I_y \in \deps{I_x}$ or $I_x \in
\deps{I_y}$ or both. Without loss of generality, assume $I_y \in \deps{I_x}$.
If $I_y$ is also in $\deps{I_x} - P_x$, then we're done. Otherwise, $I_y$ has
been pruned from $\deps{I_x}$ (i.e.\ $I_y \in P_x$). This happens only if $y$
is a $\noop$ or if $I_y$ has been chosen with $I_x \in \deps{I_y} - P_y$. $y$
is not a $\noop$, so $I_x \in \deps{I_y} - P_y$.

\subsection{Deadlock Example}\appendixlabel{DeadlockExample}
Consider a Deadlock BPaxos deployment with $n = 9$ dependency service nodes
(i.e., $f = 4$). Imagine four of these nodes have failed. The conflict graphs
of the remaining five ordering service nodes are illustrated in
\figref{DeadlockBPaxosExample}. All five dependency service nodes have
processed five commands $x_0$ through $x_4$ in instances $I_0$ through $I_4$
respectively. Every command $x_i$ conflicts with $x_{i - 1 \bmod 5}$ and $x_{i
+ 1 \bmod 5}$. For example, $x_0$ conflicts with $x_4$ and $x_1$. Dependency
service node $d_1$ has processed the five commands in the order $x_0, x_1, x_2,
x_3, x_4$, dependency service node $d_2$ has processed the five commands in the
order $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_0$, and so on.

Imagine Deadlock BPaxos node $b_i$ attempts to recover instance $I_0$.
$\QuorumMajoritySize$ acceptors have voted for $\deps{x_0} = \set{x_4}$, but
$d_2$ voted for $\set{x_1, x_4}$. Thus, $b_i$ attempts to recover $I_1$.
$\QuorumMajoritySize$ acceptors have voted for $\deps{x_1} = \set{x_0}$, but
$d_3$ voted for $\set{x_0, x_2}$, so $b_i$ attempts to recover $I_2$. This
continues until $b_i$ attempts to recover $I_4$.  $\QuorumMajoritySize$
acceptors have voted for $\deps{x_4} = \set{x_3}$, but $d_1$ voted for
$\set{x_0, x_3}$, so $b_i$ attempts to recover $I_0$. This is a deadlock.
