The remaining BPaxos protocols all leverage Fast Paxos~\cite{lamport2006fast}.
We assume a familiarity with Fast Paxos, but pause briefly to highlight the
salient bits of Fast Paxos here. For a more in-depth discussion of Fast Paxos,
refer to \appendixref{FastPaxosAppendix}.
%
Fast Paxos proceeds in a series of integer-valued rounds with $0$ being the
smallest round and $-1$ being a null round. Every round is classified either as
a fast round or a classic round. In phase 2a of the algorithm, a leader has to
choose a value to send to the acceptors. The logic for choosing this value is
shown in \algoref{FastPaxos} where $O4(v)$ is true if there exists a fast
quorum $\FastQuorum$ of acceptors such that every acceptor in $\FastQuorum \cap
\Quorum$ voted for $v$ in round $k$.
%
The key invariant of Fast Paxos is that if a value $v$ was \emph{maybe} chosen
in a round less than $i$, then a leader must propose $v$ in round $i$. This is
the case in \lineref{FastPaxosCase2Code} and \lineref{FastPaxosCase3Code} of
\algoref{FastPaxos}. A leader can propose an arbitrary value in round $i$ only
if it has concluded that no value was chosen in any round less than $i$, as is
the case in \lineref{FastPaxosCase1Code} and \lineref{FastPaxosCase4Code}.

If we assume that round $0$ is a fast round and every other round is a classic
round, we can simplify the standard phase 2a algorithm shown in
\algoref{FastPaxos} to the variant shown in \algoref{FastPaxosTweak}. As with
\algoref{FastPaxos}, a leader is sometimes forced to propose a value $v$ if it
was maybe previously chosen (i.e.\ \lineref{FastPaxosTweakCase2Code} and
\lineref{FastPaxosTweakCase3Code} of \algoref{FastPaxosTweak}). The process of
determining whether a value $v$ in \lineref{FastPaxosTweakCase3} of
\algoref{FastPaxosTweak} was maybe chosen in round $0$ is left
intentionally abstract. The correctness proof of this alternative phase 2a is
given in \appendixref{FastPaxosAppendix}.
