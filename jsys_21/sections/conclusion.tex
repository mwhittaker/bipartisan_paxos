  Our taxonomy of state machine replication protocols is summarized in
  \figref{Taxonomy}, and a summary of the generalized multi-leader protocols
  that we discuss in this paper is given in \tabref{ProtocolSummary}.

We showed via Simple \BPaxos{} that simple generalized multi-leader protocols
do exist, but they have high commit time.  Reducing the commit time with Fast
\BPaxos{}, we discovered the fundamental tension between implementing consensus
and computing dependencies between commands. We taxonomized existing protocols
according to whether they avoid the tension (like Unanimous \BPaxos{}) or they
resolve the tension (like Majority Commit \BPaxos{}). Ultimately, we hope that
the clarity we have brought to the space can encourage more industry adoption
of generalized multi-leader protocols and can spur new academic innovations in
this space.
