\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we explained, analyzed, and taxonomized generalized multi-leader
state machine replication protocols. We showed via Simple \BPaxos{} that simple
generalized multi-leader protocols do exist, but they have high commit time.
Reducing the commit time with Fast \BPaxos{}, we discovered the fundamental
tension between implementing consensus and computing dependencies between
commands. We taxonomized existing protocols according to whether they avoid the
tension (like Unanimous \BPaxos{}) or they resolve the tension (like Majority
Commit \BPaxos{}). Ultimately, we hope that the clarity we have brought to the
space can encourage more industry adoption of generalized multi-leader
protocols and can spur new academic innovations in this space.
