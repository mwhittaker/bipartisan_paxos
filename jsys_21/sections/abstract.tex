MultiPaxos and Raft are the two most popular and widely deployed state machine
replication protocols. Despite their popularity, they have suboptimal
performance. There is a more sophisticated family of generalized multi-leader
state machine replication protocols like EPaxos, Caesar, and Atlas. These
protocols have better performance but are extremely complicated and hard to
understand. Due to their complexity, they have seen little to no industry
adoption, and academically there has been a lack of clarity in analyzing,
comparing, and extending the protocols. This paper is a tutorial on generalized
multi-leader protocols. We explain why the protocols work the way they do, what
they have in common, where they differ, which parts of the protocols are
straightforward, which are more subtle than they appear, and so on. In doing
so, we present four new generalized multi-leader protocols and identify key
insights into existing protocols that we use to taxonomize the space.
