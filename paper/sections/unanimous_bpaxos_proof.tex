\section{Unanimous BPaxos}\appendixlabel{UnanimousBPaxosProof}
\begin{proof}
  If a value $v = (x, \deps{I})$ is chosen in round $0$ of instance $I$, then
  every single acceptor voted for $v$ in round $0$. An acceptor $a_j$ only
  votes for a value $v$ in round $0$, if its co-located dependency service node
  $d_j$ proposed it. Thus, every single dependency service node proposed $(x,
  \deps{I})$, so $(I, x, \deps{I})$ is a valid response from the dependency
  service.

  Otherwise, $v = (x, \deps{I})$ is chosen in round $i > 0$. In order for $v$
  to be chosen in round $i$, a Unanimous BPaxos node $b_j$ must have proposed
  $v$ in round $i$. We perform a case analysis on \algoref{FastPaxosTweak}, the
  logic that $b_j$ uses to select the value $v$.
  %
  As described in \secref{UnsafeBPaxos}, if $b_j$ executes lines
  \lineref{FastPaxosTweakCase1Code} or \lineref{FastPaxosTweakCase4Code}, then
  $b_j$ makes sure to only propose $(\noop, \emptyset)$ or $(x, \deps{I})$
  after receiving $(I, x, \deps{I})$ from the dependency service.
  %
  If $b_j$ executes \lineref{FastPaxosTweakCase3Code}, then every acceptor in
  $\Quorum$ voted for $v$ in round $0$. Thus, every dependency service node
  co-located with an acceptor in $\Quorum$ proposed $(x, \deps{I})$, so $(I, x,
  \deps{I})$ is a valid response from the dependency service.
  %
  Finally, if $b_j$ executes \lineref{FastPaxosTweakCase2Code}, a simple
  inductive argument over $i$ shows that \invref{SimpleBpaxosInvariant} holds.
