\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Asynchronous consensus is theoretically interesting and also practically
    very important.

  \item
    One of the earliest asynchronous consensus algorithms, MultiPaxos, is also
    the most commonly used one in industry. Cite a bunch of papers using Paxos.

  \item
    There are some problems with Paxos in practice, and there's been a lot of
    research on fixing them.

  \item
    High commit delay. Addressed by Fast Paxos.

  \item
    Unnecessary contention. Addressed by Generalized Paxos, GPaxos.

  \item
    Low throughput because of centralization. Addressed by Mencius, EPaxos,
    Caesar.

  \item
    Complexity and lack of modularity. More complex protocols are not built up
    of simpler protocols like how MultiPaxos is composed of Paxos. Partially
    addressed by Raft.

  \item
    We present a family of asynchronous consensus algorithms that aims to
    accomplish all of these things. It is modular, builds up complex protocol
    from simple ones, spans different trade-offs, clarifies existing research.
\end{itemize}

A table showing the following metrics for the various BPaxos variants and maybe
EPaxos.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Quorum sizes for $n$
  \item Quorum sizes for $3$
  \item Fast Quorum sizes for $n$
  \item Fast Quorum sizes for $3$
  \item Best case commit delay (from a client)
  \item What else?
\end{itemize}
