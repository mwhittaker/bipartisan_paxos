\section{The Bipartisan Paxos Protocols}\seclabel{BipartisanPaxos}
\input{figures/simple_bpaxos_graph_example.tex}

The BPaxos protocols are state machine replication protocols. We assume an
asynchronous network model, and we assume that processes are deterministic and
can fail by crashing but cannot act maliciously. Throughout the paper, we
assume at most $f$ processes can fail. Every BPaxos protocol involves a set of
$f + 1$ deterministic state machine replicas that all begin in the same initial
state. A set of clients repeatedly propose state machine commands, drawn from a
set $\Cmd$, to be executed by the state machine replicas.

Traditional state machine replication protocols~\cite{liskov2012viewstamped,
lamport1998part} reach consensus on a totally ordered log of the state machine
commands proposed by the clients, as illustrated in \figref{LinearSMR}. State
machine replicas then execute commands in log order. Because every replica
begins in the same initial state and executes commands in exactly the same
order, every replica remains in sync.
%
While simple, agreeing on a totally ordered sequence of state machine commands
can be overly prescriptive~\cite{lamport2005generalized, moraru2013there}. If
two commands \emph{do} conflict (e.g., \texttt{x=1} and \texttt{x=2}), then
they \emph{do} need to be executed by every state machine replica in the same
order.  But, if two commands do \emph{not} conflict (e.g., \texttt{x=2} and
\texttt{y=1}), then they do \emph{not} need to be totally ordered. State
machine replicas can execute them in either order.

The BPaxos protocols take advantage of this fact and order commands only if
they conflict. To do so, the BPaxos protocols ditch the totally ordered log and
instead agree on a directed graph of commands such that every pair of
conflicting commands have an edge between them. We call these graphs
\defword{partial BPaxos graphs}. An example partial BPaxos graph is illustrated
in \figref{BPaxosSMR}. State machine replicas execute commands in these graphs
in reverse topological order one strongly connected component at a time,
executing commands within a strongly component in an arbitrary but
deterministic order. Executing commands in this way, state machine replicas are
guaranteed to remain in sync. As an example, to execute the commands in
\figref{BPaxosSMR}, replicas first execute \texttt{x=1;y=2}, then \texttt{x=2}
and \texttt{y=1} in either order, and then \texttt{x=3;y=4} and \texttt{x=2} in
some deterministic order (e.g., in order of increasing hash).

With traditional state machine replication protocols, every command is assigned
a unique integer log entry number. These are drawn in red in
\figref{LinearSMR}. The BPaxos protocols follow suit and also assign each
command a unique identifier, called an \defword{instance}. For example, the
command \texttt{y=1} in \figref{BPaxosSMR} is in instance $I_3$. Every instance
$I$ in a partial BPaxos graph has a number of outbound edges to other instances
called the dependencies of $I$, denoted $\deps{I}$. For example, in
\figref{BPaxosSMR}, $\deps{I_5} = \set{I_1, I_4}$.
%
The BPaxos protocols construct partial BPaxos graphs one instance at a time,
reaching consensus on the command $x$ in the instance as well as the instance's
dependencies. That is, for every instance $I$, the BPaxos protocols agree on a
tuple $(x, \deps{I})$.
%
The correctness of the BPaxos protocols hinges on the following two key
invariants.

\begin{invariant}[Instance Consensus]\invlabel{ConsensusInvariant}
  The BPaxos protocols successfully implement consensus for every instance $I$.
  That is, at most one value $(x, \deps{I})$ is chosen in instance $I$
  (consistency), and if the value $(x, \deps{I})$ is chosen, then it was
  previously proposed (nontriviality).
\end{invariant}%
%
\begin{invariant}[Visibility]\invlabel{ConflictInvariant}
  If $(x, \deps{I_x})$ is chosen in instance $I_x$ and $(y, \deps{I_y})$ is
  chosen in instance $I_y$, and if $x$ and $y$ conflict, then either $I_x \in
  \deps{I_y}$ or $I_y \in \deps{I_x}$ or both.
\end{invariant}

There are three BPaxos protocols: Simple BPaxos, Unanimous BPaxos, and Majority
Commit BPaxos, summarized in \tabref{BPaxosSummary}. The three protocols differ
in various ways (e.g., quorum sizes, commit latencies), but all
three follow the structure described above. They all reach consensus on a
partial BPaxos graph one instance at a time; they all execute commands in a
partial BPaxos graph in reverse topological order; and they all maintain \invref{ConsensusInvariant} and
\invref{ConflictInvariant}. In the rest of the paper, we introduce the
three protocols one by one and prove that each maintains the two key
invariants. For a more formal overview of the BPaxos protocols and a discussion
on why the two key protocols suffice for correctness, refer to
\secref{FormalBPaxosOverview}.

% and the vertex's outbound edges as a little gadget. For example,

% %
% More formally, we can think of these gadgets as tuples like $(Q.1,
% \texttt{y+=x}, \set{R.1, R.2, Q.2})$ where $Q.1$ is the instance, \texttt{y+=x}
% is the command in the instance, and the set $\set{R.1, R.2, Q.2}$ is the set of
% \defword{dependencies} of $Q.1$ (or of \texttt{y+=x} if $Q.1$ is clear from
% context).

%
% \begin{boxedinvariant}\invlabel{GadgetsChosen}

% \end{boxedinvariant}
%
% \begin{boxedinvariant}\invlabel{ConflictingGadgets}
%   If two gadgets $(I_a, a, \deps{a})$ and $(I_b, b, \deps{b})$ are chosen and

%   \deps{a}$ or both.
% \end{boxedinvariant}
%
% BPaxos, like EPaxos, also constructs a directed graph of commands and executes
% them in reverse topological order one strongly connected component at a time.
% In fact, BPaxos and EPaxos execute commands in 100\% the same way. BPaxos also
% maintains the same two key invariants as EPaxos. BPaxos and EPaxos differ only
% in how they construct the directed graph of commands.
% %
% BPaxos is illustrated in \figref{BPaxos}. A BPaxos instance has three main
% components: an ordering service, a consensus service, and a set of BPaxos
% nodes. The ordering service helps provide \invref{ConflictingGadgets}, the
% consensus service helps provide \invref{GadgetsChosen}, and the BPaxos nodes
% glue the two together. We explain each of these three components in turn.







%
% We consider a set $\Cmd$ of state machine commands and define a
% conflict relation $\conflict$ such that two commands $x, y \in \Cmd$ conflict
% if they do not commute--i.e.\ if there exists a state in which executing $x$
% and then $y$ does not produce the same responses and final state as executing
% $y$ and then $x$.



% MultiPaxos allows a set of nodes to agree on a totally ordered sequence of
% state machine commands. This is illustrated in \figref{MultiPaxosCartoon}.
%
% While simple, agreeing on a totally ordered sequence of state machine commands
% can be overly prescriptive. If two commands conflict (e.g., \texttt{x = 1} and
% \texttt{x = 2}), then they \emph{do} need to be executed by every state machine

% \texttt{x = 1} and \texttt{y = 1}), then they do \emph{not} need to be totally
% ordered.  State machine replicas can execute them in either order.
%
% EPaxos takes advantage of this fact and attempts to order commands only if they

% }.
% EPaxos then executes this graph in reverse topological order one strongly

% EPaxos nodes collectively construct the directed graph of commands by stitching

% gadget for instance $R.i$ and attempts to get the gadget chosen. Once a gadget
% is chosen, it is considered part of the directed graph and is eligible for

% %
% BPaxos is illustrated in \figref{BPaxos}. A BPaxos instance has three main

% nodes. The ordering service helps provide \invref{ConflictingGadgets}, the
% consensus service helps provide \invref{GadgetsChosen}, and the BPaxos nodes
% glue the two together. We explain each of these three components in turn.
%
% {\input{figures/bpaxos.tex}}
%
% \paragraph{Ordering Service}
% The ordering service is responsible for computing the dependencies between
% conflicting state machine commands. When a BPaxos node $R$ receives a state
% machine command $a$ from a client, it chooses a unique instance $R.i$ for $a$.
% Then, $R$ sends $(R.i, a)$ to the ordering service. When the ordering service
% receives $(R.i, a)$, it replies with a tuple $(R.i, a, \deps{a})$ where
% $\deps{a} = \set{I_1, \ldots, I_n}$ is a set of instances called $a$'s
% dependencies. The ordering service maintains the following invariant.
%
% \begin{boxedinvariant}\invlabel{OrderingService}
% If two conflicting commands $a$ and $b$ in instances $I_a$ and $I_b$ yield
% responses $(I_a, a, \deps{a})$ and $(I_b, b, \deps{b})$ from the ordering
% service, then either $I_a \in \deps{b}$ or $I_b \in \deps{a}$ (or both). That
% is, if two conflicting commands produce responses from the ordering service, at
% least one is guaranteed to be a dependency of the other.
% \end{boxedinvariant}
%
% There are a couple things to note about the ordering service:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item
%     The ordering service has a precondition that at most one command can be
%     sent to the ordering service in any given instance. That is, if a BPaxos
%     node sends command $(R.i, a)$ to the ordering service, then no other BPaxos
%     node can send $(R.i, b)$ to the ordering service for some other command
%     $b$.
%
%   \item
%     It's possible that a BPaxos node (or multiple BPaxos nodes) sends the tuple
%     $(R.i, a)$ to the ordering service more than once. The ordering service
%     does not guarantee that all of the responses to these requests are the
%     same.  For example, BPaxos node $R$ may send $(R.1, a)$ to the ordering
%     service and get a response $(R.1, a, \set{Q.1, R.2})$. Later, $Q$ might
%     send $(R.1, a)$ to the ordering service and get a different response of
%     $(R.1, a, \set{Q.2, R.1})$. Note that even though the ordering service may
%     produce different responses for the same request, the ordering service
%     maintains \invref{OrderingService} for every possible pair of ordering
%     service responses.
% \end{itemize}
%
% \newcommand{\out}{\text{out}}
% Implementing a fault tolerant ordering service is straightforward. We employ
% $2f + 1$ ordering service nodes $o_{1}, \ldots, o_{2f + 1}$. When a BPaxos node
% $R$ sends a command $a$ in instance $R.i$ to the ordering service, it sends the
% tuple $(R.i, a)$ to all $2f + 1$ of the ordering service nodes. Every ordering
% service node $o_i$ maintains a directed acyclic graph $G_i$. Every vertex of
% the graph is labelled with a BPaxos instance and contains a state machine
% command. When $o_i$ receives a command $a$ for instance $R.i$ from a Fast
% BPaxos node, it performs the following actions:
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item
%     Let $\out(R.i)$ be the set of outbound edges emanating from the vertex
%     labelled $R.i$. If there is already a vertex in $G_i$ labelled $R.i$, then
%     $o_i$ returns $(R.i, a, \out(R.i))$ and does nothing else.  Note that the
%     ordering service's precondition that most one command can be sent in any
%     given instance guarantees that command stored in vertex $R.i$ is $a$.
%   \item
%     If there does not exist a vertex labelled $R.i$ in $G_i$, then $o_i$
%     inserts a vertex into $G_i$ with label $R.i$ and with command $a$. An edge
%     is added from instance $R.i$ to instance $Q.j$ for every other instance
%     $Q.j$ in the graph that contains a command $b$ that conflicts with $a$.
%     $o_i$ then returns the tuple $(R.i, a, \out(R.i))$.
% \end{enumerate}
%
% An example of such a graph is given in
% \figref{FastPaxosOrderingServiceCartoonBefore}. The same graph is shown
% \figref{FastPaxosOrderingServiceCartoonAfter}, except that the command $e$ has
% arrived in instance $Q.2$ and conflicts with commands $c$ and $d$.
%
% {\input{figures/ordering_service_cartoon.tex}}
%
% There are a couple of things worth noting about an ordering service node $o_i$
% and the corresponding graph $G_i$.
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item
%     $G_i$ is always acyclic.
%   \item
%     One a gadget $(I_a, a, \out(I_a))$ is inserted into $G_i$, the gadget is
%     never modified.
%   \item
%     The edges in $G_i$ reflect the order in which conflicting commands were
%     received by $o_i$. If there is an edge from instance $I_a$ to instance
%     $I_b$, then $o_i$ must have received command $b$ in $I_b$ before receiving
%     command $a$ in $I_a$.
%   \item
%     EPaxos and BPaxos both construct a directed cyclic graph of commands that
%     are then executed in reverse topological order by strongly component. This
%     graph is not the same graph as $G_i$.  $G_i$ is a completely separate graph
%     that serves a completely different purpose.
% \end{itemize}
%
% When a BPaxos node receives replies $(R.i, a, \deps{a}_{i_1}), \ldots, (R.i, a,
% \deps{a}_{i_{f+1}})$ from a quorum $\quorum_a$ of $f + 1$ ordering service
% nodes, it takes $(R.i, a, \deps{a}_{i_1} \cup \ldots \cup \deps{a}_{i_{f+1}})$
% to be the response from the ordering service. That is, it computes $\deps{a}$
% by taking the union of $\deps{a}_i$ from a majority of the ordering service
% nodes.
%
% To understand why this ordering service implementation maintains
% \invref{OrderingService}, consider conflicting commands $a$ and $b$ in
% instances $I_a$ and $I_b$. Assume $a$'s reply $(I_a, a, \deps{a})$ was formed
% from a quorum $\quorum_a$ and $b$'s reply $(I_b, b, \deps{b})$ was formed from
% a quorum $\quorum_b$. Any two quorums intersect, so $\quorum_a \cap \quorum_b$
% is nonempty. Let $o_i$ be an ordering service node in this intersection. $o_i$
% either received $a$ or $b$ first. If it received $a$ first, then $G_i$ has a
% vertex $I_a$ that contained $a$ when $o_i$ processed command $b$, so $o_i$
% includes $I_a$ in $\deps{b}_i$, so $I_a$ is in $\deps{b}$. Symmetrically, if
% $o_i$ received $b$ first, then it includes $I_b$ in $\deps{a}$.
%
% \paragraph{Consensus Service}
% We assume we have some set $p_1, \ldots, p_n$ of nodes that implement Plain
% Jane consensus. A BPaxos node can propose to the consensus service that some
% value $v$ be chosen in some instance $I$. The consensus service replies with
% the value that has been chosen in instance $I$, which may or may not be $v$
% depending on if there are concurrent proposers proposing to instance $i$. The
% consensus service guarantees that for every instance $I$, at most one value is
% ever chosen in $I$.
%
% We can implement the consensus service with one Paxos instance for every BPaxos
% instance, with consensus service nodes playing the role of Paxos acceptors and
% the BPaxos nodes playing the role of Paxos proposers. Similar to MultiPaxos, we
% can have each BPaxos node $R$ serve as the leader for every Paxos instance
% $R.i$. Initially, $R$ runs phase 1 of Paxos for every instance $R.i$, so that
% later, $R$ can get a command committed in instance $R.i$ in one round trip to
% the consensus service (in the best case).
%
% \paragraph{BPaxos Nodes}
% We assume a fixed set $R_1, \ldots, R_{2f+1}$ of $2f + 1$ BPaxos nodes.
% %
% Clients sends state machine commands to BPaxos nodes to be executed by the
% replicated state machine. When a BPaxos node $R$ receives a command $a$, it
% sends the command to the ordering service in a previously unused instance $R.i$
% and receives a reply $(R.i, a, \deps{a})$. $R$ then proposes the value $(a,
% \deps{a})$ to the consensus service in instance $R.i$. The consensus service
% then replies with some chosen value $(a', \deps{a'})$ (which is equal to $(a,
% \deps{a})$ in the failure-free case). At this point, the gadget $(R.i, a',
% \deps{a'})$ is considered chosen in the directed graph of state machine
% commands and is eligible for execution. Node $R$ also informs the other BPaxos
% nodes that the value $(a', \deps{a'})$ has been chosen.
%
% As noted earlier, the execution of the commands in the directed graph is
% identical to that of EPaxos. Committed commands are executed in reverse
% topological order, one strongly connected component at a time. Within a
% strongly connected component, BPaxos executes commands in an arbitrary but
% deterministic order. Unlike with EPaxos, BPaxos does not annotate instances
% with sequence numbers. To provide linearizability, when a BPaxos node $R$
% receives command $a$ from a client, $R$ does not respond to the client until
% the command $a$ has been executed by the replicated state machine. If $R$
% returns to the client immediately after $a$ is chosen (as with EPaxos), then
% BPaxos provides serializability instead of linearizability.
%
% % Mention that we don't HAVE to no-op.
% Note that it's possible that (1) a committed command $a$ depends on an
% uncommitted instance $Q.j$, and (2) the BPaxos node $Q$ that manages the
% instance $Q.j$ has crashed. If the instance $Q.j$ remains forever uncommitted,
% then the command $a$ will never be executed. To avoid this liveness violation,
% if any BPaxos node $R$ notices that instance $Q.j$ has been uncommitted for
% some time, it can perform one of the following actions:
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item
%     $R$ can propose to the consensus service that the value $(\noop,
%     \emptyset)$ be chosen in instance $Q.j$ where $\noop$ is a command that
%     doesn't affect the state machine and doesn't conflict with any other
%     command. Note that $R$ does not contact the ordering service here. $R$
%     contacts the consensus service directly.
%
%   \item
%     $R$ can contact the ordering service and check if any ordering service node
%     has recorded a command $b$ in instance $Q.j$. If such a command exists, $R$
%     can send the tuple $(Q.j, b)$ to the ordering service, and propose the
%     resulting dependencies. If no such command exists, $R$ can propose a
%     $\noop$.
% \end{enumerate}
%
% \paragraph{Correctness}
% BPaxos maintains \invref{GadgetsChosen} trivially because it chooses commands
% using consensus. The ordering service maintains \invref{OrderingService}, which
% says that the dependencies computed for conflicting commands $a$ and $b$ will
% have one in the other (or both). \invref{ConflictingGadgets} says that the
% dependencies of conflicting \emph{chosen} commands $a$ and $b$ will have one in
% the other (or both). Thus, BPaxos nodes maintain \invref{ConflictingGadgets} by
% only proposing dependencies computed by the ordering service. BPaxos nodes also
% propose $\noop$'s with empty dependencies, but since $\noop$s do not conflict
% with any command, \invref{ConflictingGadgets} is satisfied trivially.
%
% Now, we discuss why \invref{GadgetsChosen} and \invref{ConflictingGadgets}
% ensure BPaxos' correctness. Fortunate for us, EPaxos maintains the same two
% invariants, so we can leverage EPaxos' proof of correctness. Open up
% \cite{moraru2013proof} and head to section 5.6, which contains proofs of
% EPaxos' correctness.
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item
%     \textbf{Theorem 1} says that EPaxos satisfies nontriviality. Clearly, so
%     does BPaxos.
%
%   \item
%     \textbf{Lemma 1} is \invref{GadgetsChosen}. As we saw, BPaxos maintains
%     this invariant.
%
%   \item
%     \textbf{Theorem 2} follows from Lemma 1.
%
%   \item
%     \textbf{Theorem 3} is trivial.
%
%   \item
%     \textbf{Theorem 4} states that if two conflicting commands are both
%     committed, then they will be executed in the same order by every BPaxos
%     node. This follows from \invref{ConflictingGadgets}. If two commands
%     conflict, then one will depend on the other or both. If both commands end
%     up in the same strongly connected component, they will be executed in the
%     same deterministic order. And, if the commands end up in different strongly
%     connected components, then one component is guaranteed to be ordered before
%     the other, so the two commands are executed in reverse topological order.
% \end{itemize}
