\section{The Bipartisan Paxos Protocols}\seclabel{BipartisanPaxos}
The BPaxos protocols are state machine replication protocols. We assume an
asynchronous network model, deterministic execution, and fail-stop failures,
i.e., nodes can fail by crashing but cannot act maliciously. Throughout the
paper, we assume at most $f$ processes can fail. Every BPaxos protocol involves
a set of $f + 1$ deterministic state machine replicas that all start in the
same initial state. A set of clients repeatedly propose commands, drawn from a
set $\Cmd$, to be executed by the state machine replicas.

Traditional state machine replication protocols~\cite{liskov2012viewstamped,
lamport1998part} reach consensus on a totally ordered log of state machine
commands, as illustrated in \figref{LinearSMR}. State machine replicas then
execute commands in log order. Because every replica starts in the same initial
state and executes deterministic commands in exactly the same order,
they all remain in sync.
%
While simple, agreeing on a totally ordered sequence of state machine commands
can be overly prescriptive~\cite{lamport2005generalized, moraru2013there}. We
say two commands $x$ and $y$ \defword{conflict} if they do not commute--i.e.\
there exists a state in which executing $x$ and then $y$ does not produce the
same responses and final state as executing $y$ and then $x$. If two commands
\emph{do} conflict (e.g., \texttt{x=1} and \texttt{x=2}), then they \emph{do}
need to be executed by every state machine replica in the same order.  But, if
two commands do \emph{not} conflict (e.g., \texttt{x=2} and \texttt{y=1}), then
they do \emph{not} need to be totally ordered. State machine replicas can
execute them in either order.

The BPaxos protocols leverage this observation and order commands only if they
conflict. To do so, the BPaxos protocols abandon the totally ordered log and
instead agree on a directed graph of commands such that every pair of
conflicting commands have an edge between them. We call these graphs
\defword{partial BPaxos graphs}. An example partial BPaxos graph is illustrated
in \figref{BPaxosSMR}. Note that every pair of conflicting commands in
\figref{BPaxosSMR} have an edge between them, and some conflicting commands
(e.g., \texttt{y=x} and \texttt{x=2}) have edges in both directions, forming a
cycle. The process by which these partial BPaxos graphs are built is explained
in the next couple of sections.

State machine replicas execute commands in these partial BPaxos graphs in
reverse topological order, one strongly connected component at a time, executing
commands within a strongly component in an arbitrary but deterministic order.
Executing commands in this way, state machine replicas are guaranteed to remain
in sync. As an example, consider again the partial BPaxos graph shown in
\figref{BPaxosSMR}. This graph has four strongly connected components, each
shaded a different color. Replicas execute these four strongly connected
components in reverse topological order. Replicas first execute \texttt{x=y},
then \texttt{x=2} and \texttt{y=1} in either order, and then \texttt{y=x} and
\texttt{x=2} in some arbitrary but deterministic order (e.g., in order of
increasing hash).

Moreover, traditional state machine replication protocols assign every command
a unique log entry number, as shown in \figref{LinearSMR}. The BPaxos protocols
follow suit and also assign each command a unique identifier, called an
\defword{instance}. For example, the command \texttt{y=1} in \figref{BPaxosSMR}
is in instance $I_3$. Every instance $I$ in a partial BPaxos graph has a number
of outbound edges to other instances called the \defword{dependencies} of $I$,
denoted $\deps{I}$. For example, in \figref{BPaxosSMR}, $\deps{I_5} = \set{I_1,
I_4}$.
%
The BPaxos protocols construct partial BPaxos graphs one instance at a time,
reaching consensus on the command $x$ in the instance as well as the instance's
dependencies $\deps{I}$. That is, for every instance $I$, the BPaxos protocols
agree on a tuple $(x, \deps{I})$.
%
The correctness of the BPaxos protocols hinges on the following two key
invariants.

\begin{invariant}\invlabel{ConsensusInvariant}
  The BPaxos protocols successfully implement consensus for every instance $I$.
  That is, at most one value $(x, \deps{I})$ is chosen in instance $I$
  (consistency), and if the value $(x, \deps{I})$ is chosen, then it was
  previously proposed (nontriviality).
\end{invariant}%
%
\begin{invariant}\invlabel{ConflictInvariant}
  If $(x, \deps{I_x})$ is chosen in instance $I_x$ and $(y, \deps{I_y})$ is
  chosen in instance $I_y$, and if $x$ and $y$ conflict, then either $I_x \in
  \deps{I_y}$ or $I_y \in \deps{I_x}$ or both.
\end{invariant}

There are three BPaxos protocols: Simple BPaxos, Unanimous BPaxos, and Majority
Commit BPaxos, summarized in \tabref{BPaxosSummary}. The three protocols differ
in various ways (e.g., quorum sizes, commit latencies), but all three follow
the structure described above. They all reach consensus on a partial BPaxos
graph one instance at a time; they all execute commands in a partial BPaxos
graph in reverse topological order; and they all maintain
\invref{ConsensusInvariant} and \invref{ConflictInvariant}. In the rest of the
paper, we introduce the three protocols one by one and prove that each
maintains the two key invariants. For a more formal overview of the BPaxos
protocols and a discussion on why the two key invariants suffice for
correctness, refer to \appendixref{FormalBPaxosOverview}.
