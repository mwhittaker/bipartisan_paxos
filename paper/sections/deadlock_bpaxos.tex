\section{Deadlock BPaxos}
In this section, we present \defword{Deadlock BPaxos}, a slight tweak to
Unanimous BPaxos. Like Unanimous BPaxos, Deadlock BPaxos can choose a command
in one round trip, but unlike Unanimous BPaxos, Deadlock BPaxos only requires
fast quorums of size $\SuperQuorumSize$ (the same as Fast Paxos).
%
While Deadlock BPaxos is safe, it is not very live. There are failure-free
situations in which Deadlock Paxos can deadlock. Thus, Deadlock BPaxos, like
Unsafe BPaxos, is a purely pedagogical protocol. In the next section, we fix
Deadlock BPaxos's lack of liveness.

\subsection{Pruned Dependencies}
We'll discuss Deadlock BPaxos momentarily, but first we pause to understand one
of the key invariants that it maintains. Recall that in order to preserve
\invref{ConflictInvariant}, both Simple BPaxos and Unanimous BPaxos maintain
\invref{SimpleBpaxosInvariant}.
%
Deadlock BPaxos does not maintain this invariant. Instead, it maintains an
invariant that is slightly weaker but still sufficient to imply
\invref{ConflictInvariant}. The motivation for the weaker invariant is as
follows.

Imagine a Deadlock BPaxos node $b_i$ sends command $x$ to the dependency
service in instance $I$, and the dependency service responds with $(I, x,
\deps{I})$. Let $I' \in \deps{I}$ be one of $I$'s dependencies. Assume that
that $b_i$ knows that $I'$ has been chosen with command $y$ and dependencies
$\deps{I'}$. Further assume that $I \in \deps{I'}$. In this case, there is no
need for $b_i$ to include $I'$ in the dependencies of $I$!
\invref{ConflictInvariant} asserts that if two instances $I$ and $I'$ are
chosen with conflicting commands $x$ and $y$, then either $I \in \deps{I'}$ or
$I' \in \deps{I}$. Thus, if $I'$ has already been chosen with a dependency on
$I$, then there is no need to propose $I$ with a dependency on $I'$.
%
Similarly, if $I'$ has been chosen with $\noop$, then there is no need to
propose $I$ with a dependency to $I'$ because $x$ and $\noop$ do not conflict.

Let $(I, x, \deps{I})$ be a response from the dependency service. Let $P$ be a
set of instances $I'$ such that $I'$ has been chosen with $\noop$ or $I'$ has
been chosen with $I \in \deps{I'}$. We call $\deps{I} - P$ the \defword{pruned
dependencies} of $I$ with respect to $P$. We'll see momentarily that Deadlock
BPaxos ensures that if a value $(I, x, \deps{I})$ is chosen in instance $I$

\begin{invariant}\invlabel{PrunedDependencies}
  For every instance $I$, a value $v$ is chosen in instance $I$ only if $v =
  (\noop, \emptyset)$ or if $(I, x, \deps{I})$ is a response from the
  dependency service and $v = (I, x, \deps{I} - P)$ where $\deps{I} - P$ are
  the pruned dependencies of $I$ with respect to some set $P$.
\end{invariant}

\invref{DependencyService} and \invref{PrunedDependencies} imply
\invref{ConflictInvariant}. To see why, consider two conflicting commands $x$
and $y$ chosen in instances $I_x$ and $I_y$. $x$ and $y$ conflict, so neither
is $\noop$. Thus, by \invref{PrunedDependencies}, $I_x$ is chosen with pruned
dependencies $\deps{I_x} - P_x$ and $I_y$ is chosen with pruned dependencies
$\deps{I_y} - P_y$ derived from dependencies $\deps{I_x}$ and $\deps{I_y}$
computed by the dependency service. We want to show that $I_x \in \deps{I_y} -
P_y$ or $I_y \in \deps{I_x} - P_x$, or both.
%
By \invref{DependencyService}, either $I_y \in \deps{I_x}$ or $I_x \in
\deps{I_y}$ or both. Without loss of generality, assume $I_y \in \deps{I_x}$.
If $I_y$ is also in $\deps{I_x} - P_x$, then we're done. Otherwise, $I_y$ has
been pruned from $\deps{I_x}$ (i.e.\ $I_y \in P_x$). This happens only if $y$
is a $\noop$ or if $I_y$ has been chosen with $I_x \in \deps{I_y} - P_y$. $y$
is not a $\noop$, so $I_x \in \deps{I_y} - P_y$.

\end{wrapfigure}

Deadlock BPaxos is identical to Unanimous BPaxos except for the
following modifications.
%
First, Deadlock BPaxos fast quorums are of size $\SuperQuorumSize$.
%
Second, every Fast Paxos acceptor maintains a partial BPaxos graph in exactly
the same way as the set of Deadlock BPaxos nodes. When an acceptor learns that
an instance $I$ has been chosen with command $x$ and dependencies $\deps{I}$,
it adds $I$ to its partial BPaxos graph labelled with $x$ and with edges to
every instance in $\deps{I}$.  We'll see momentarily that whenever a Deadlock
BPaxos node $b_i$ sends a phase 2a message to acceptors with value $v = (x,
\deps{I} - P)$ for some pruned dependencies $\deps{I} - P$, $b_i$ includes $P$
and all of the values chosen in $P$ in the phase 2a message. Thus, when an
acceptor receives a phase 2a message, it updates its partial BPaxos graph with
the values chosen in $P$.
%
Third, as discussed above, Deadlock BPaxos maintains
\invref{PrunedDependencies} instead of \invref{SimpleBpaxosInvariant}.
%
Fourth and most substantially, when a Deadlock BPaxos node $b_i$ executes
\lineref{FastPaxosTweakCase3} of \algoref{FastPaxosTweak} for instance $I$, it
performs a much more sophisticated procedure to determine if some value $v \in
V$ may have been chosen in round $0$. This procedure is shown in
\algoref{DeadlockBPaxos}.

In line 1, $b_i$ determines whether there exists some $v \in V$ that satisfies
$O4(v)$. $O4(v)$ is a necessary condition for $v$ to have been chosen in round
$0$, so if no such $v$ exists, then no value could have been chosen in round
$0$. Thus, in line 2, $b_i$ is free to propose any value that maintains
\invref{PrunedDependencies}.
%
Otherwise, there does exist a $v = (x, \deps{I}) \in V$ satisfying $O4(v)$. As
we saw with Unsafe BPaxos, $b_i$ cannot blindly propose $v$ without risk of
violating \invref{ConflictInvariant}. Instead, $b_i$ has to do a bit of extra
work to conclude either that $v$ is safe to propose or that $b_i$ is safe to
propose a different value.

In lines $4$ and $5$, $b_i$ sends $(I, x)$ to the dependency service nodes
co-located with the acceptors in $\Quorum$ and receives the corresponding
dependency service reply $(I, x, \deps{I}_\Quorum)$%
\footnote{%
  Note that $(I, x)$ messages can be piggybacked on the phase 1a messages
  previously sent by $b_i$. This eliminates the extra round trip.
}.
$\deps{I}_\Quorum$ is the union of the dependencies computed by these
co-located dependency service nodes. Moreover, a majority of these co-located
dependency service nodes computed the dependencies of $I$ to be $\deps{I}$
(because $O4(v)$). Thus, $\deps{I} \subseteq \deps{I}_\Quorum$.

Next, $b_i$ enters a for loop in an attempt to prune $\deps{I}_\Quorum$ until
it is equal to $\deps{I}$. That is, $b_i$ attempts to construct a set of
instances $P$ such that $\deps{I} = \deps{I}_\Quorum - P$ is a set of pruned
dependencies. For every, $I' \in \deps{I}_\Quorum - \deps{I}$, $b_i$ first
recovers $I'$ if $b_i$ does not know if a value has been chosen in instance
$I'$. After recovery, say $b_i$ learns that $I'$ is chosen with value $(x',
\deps{I'})$. If $x' = \noop$ or if $I \in \deps{I'}$, then $b_i$ can safely
prune $I'$ from $\deps{I}_\Quorum$, so it adds $I'$ to $P$.
%
Otherwise, $b_i$ contacts some quorum $\Quorum'$ of acceptors. If any acceptor
$a_j$ in $\Quorum'$ knows that instance $I$ has already been chosen, then $b_i$
can abort the recovery of $I$ and retrieve the chosen value directly from
$a_j$. Otherwise, in line 19, $b_i$ concludes that $v$ was not chosen in round
$0$ and is free to propose any value that maintains
\invref{PrunedDependencies}. We will explain momentarily why $b_i$ is able to
make such a conclusion. It is not obvious.
%
Finally, if $b_i$ exits the for loop, then it has successfully pruned
$\deps{I}_\Quorum$ into $\deps{I}_\Quorum - P = \deps{I}$ and can safely
propose it. As described above, when $b_i$ sends a phase 2a message with value
$v$, it also includes the values chosen in every instance in $P$.

We now return to line 19 and explain how $b_i$ is able to conclude that $v$ was
not chosen in round $0$. On line 19, $b_i$ has already concluded that $I'$ was
not chosen with $\noop$ and that $I \notin \deps{I'}$. By
\invref{PrunedDependencies}, $\deps{I'} = \deps{I'}_{\Quorum'} - P'$ is a set
of pruned dependencies where $\deps{I'}_{\Quorum'}$ is a set of dependencies
computed by a quorum $\Quorum'$ of dependency service nodes. Because $I \notin
\deps{I'}_{\Quorum'} - P'$, either $I \notin \deps{I'}_{\Quorum'}$ or $I \in
P'$.
%
$I$ cannot be in $P'$ because if $I'$ were chosen with dependencies
$\deps{I'}_{\Quorum'} - P'$, then some quorum of acceptors would have received
$P'$ and learned that $I$ was chosen. But, when $b_i$ contacted the quorum
$\Quorum'$ of acceptors, none knew that $I$ was chosen, and any two quorums
intersect.
%
Thus, $I \notin \deps{I'}_{\Quorum'}$. Thus, every dependency service node in
$\Quorum'$ processed instance $I'$ before instance $I$. If not, then a
dependency service node in $\Quorum'$ would have computed $I$ as a dependency
of $I'$. However, if every dependency service node in $\Quorum'$ processed $I'$
before $I$, then there cannot exist a fast quorum of dependency service nodes
that processed $I$ before $I'$. In this case, $v = (x, \deps{I})$ could not
have been chosen in round $0$ because it necessitates a fast quorum of
dependency service nodes processing $I$ before $I'$ because $I' \notin
\deps{I}$.


% \section{Deadlock Bipartisan Paxos}
% In this section, we present \defword{Deadlock Bipartisan Paxos}. Deadlock
% BPaxos can commit commands in one round trip like Unanimous BPaxos, but
% Deadlock BPaxos only requires a superquorum size of $f + \floor{\frac{f}{2}} +
% 1$. Unfortunately, there are situations in which Deadlock Paxos can deadlock.
% We will fix this pesky liveness problem in the next section.
%
% \paragraph{Ordering Service}
% Deadlock BPaxos uses the same ordering service as BPaxos and Unanimous BPaxos.
%
% \paragraph{Consensus Service}
% Deadlock BPaxos uses the same consensus service as Unanimous BPaxos, except
% that Deadlock BPaxos uses a superquorums size of $$,
% the same as regular Fast Paxos.
%
% \paragraph{Overview}
% In the normal case, Deadlock BPaxos nodes behave exactly like Unanimous BPaxos
% nodes. Upon receiving a command $a$ from a client, a Deadlock BPaxos node $R$
% chooses some previously unused instance $R.i$ for the command. It then sends
% $(R.i, a)$ to the ordering service nodes.
% %
% When an ordering service node $o_j$ receives $(R.i, a)$, it proposes it's reply
% $(R.i, a, \deps{a}_j)$ to $p_j$, the colocated Paxos acceptor. $p_j$ then sends
% its vote back to $R$.
% %
% If $R$ receives a superquorum of matching votes $(R.i, a, \deps{a})$, then the
% gadget is considered chosen. If it does not receive a superquorum of matching
% votes, it enters recovery.
%
% Recovery is where Deadlock BPaxos differs from the incorrect BPaxos variant in
% \secref{IncorrectBPaxos} and from Unanimous BPaxos. Deadlock BPaxos proposers
% implement Case 2 and Case 3 of \algoref{FastPaxosTweak} as described in
% \algoref{DeadlockBPaxos}. The bulk of the complexity comes from resolving the
% tension between maintaining \invref{GadgetsChosen} and
% \invref{ConflictingGadgets}, as exemplified by the upper right corner of
% \figref{BPaxosLogic}.
%
% \paragraph{Pruned Dependencies}
% We'll walk through \algoref{DeadlockBPaxos} momentarily, but first we pause to
% understand one of the key invariants that it maintains. Recall that in order to
% preserve \invref{ConflictingGadgets}, both BPaxos and Unanimous BPaxos maintain
% the invariant that a proposer can only propose a value $(a, \deps{a})$ if
% either $\deps{a}$ is a response from the ordering service or if $(a, \deps{a})
% = (\noop, \emptyset)$.
%
% Deadlock BPaxos does not maintain this invariant, Instead, it maintains an
% invariant that is slightly weaker but still strong enough to imply
% \invref{ConflictingGadgets}. The motivation for the weaker invariant is as
% follows. Imagine a Deadlock BPaxos node $R$ sends command $a$ to the ordering
% service in instance $I_a$, and the ordering service responds with $(I_a, a,
% \deps{a})$. Let $I_b \in \deps{a}$ be one of $a$'s dependencies. Assume that
% that $R$ knows that $I_b$ has been committed with command $b$ and dependencies
% $\deps{b}$. Further assume that $I_a \in \deps{b}$. That is, there is an edge
% from $I_b$ to $I_a$. In this case, there is no need for $R$ to include $I_b$ in
% the dependencies of $I_a$! \invref{ConflictingGadgets} asserts that if two
% committed commands conflict, one has an edge to the other (or both). If $I_b$
% has already committed with an edge to $I_a$, there is no need to propose an
% edge from $I_a$ back to $I_b$.
% %
% Similarly, if $I_b$ has been committed with a $\noop$, then there is no need to
% propose an edge from $I_a$ to $I_b$ at all because $a$ and $\noop$ do not
% conflict.
%
% Let $(I_a, a, \deps{a})$ be a response from the ordering service. Let
% $\Pnoop{a}$ be a set of instances $I_c$ in $\deps{a}$ such that $I_c$ has been
% committed as a $\noop$. Similarly, let $\Pnotnoop{a}$ be a set of instances
% $I_c$ in $\deps{a}$ such that $I_c$ has been committed with $I_a$ in
% $\deps{c}$. Note that in this case, $c$ is not a $\noop$. We call
% $\pruned(\deps{a}) = \deps{a} - (\Pnoop{a} \cup \Pnotnoop{a})$ the
% \defword{pruned dependencies} of $I_a$ (or sometimes the pruned dependencies of
% $a$ if $I_a$ is clear from context).  Deadlock BPaxos maintains the following
% invariant:
%
% \begin{boxedinvariant}\invlabel{PrunedDependencies}
%   In Paxos instance $I_a$, A Deadlock BPaxos node will only propose a value of
%   the form $(a, \pruned(\deps{a}))$ where $\pruned(\deps{a})$ is a pruned
%   response from the ordering service or a value of the form $(\noop,
%   \emptyset)$.
% \end{boxedinvariant}
%
% \invref{GadgetsChosen} and \invref{PrunedDependencies} imply
% \invref{ConflictingGadgets}. To see why, consider two conflicting commands $a$
% and $b$ chosen in instances $I_a$ and $I_b$ with pruned dependencies
% $\pruned(\deps{a})$ and $\pruned(\deps{b})$ derived from unpruned dependencies
% $\deps{a}$ and $\deps{b}$ from the ordering service. We want to show that $I_a
% \in \pruned(\deps{a})$ or $I_b \in \pruned(\deps{a})$, or both. Note that $a$
% and $b$ conflict, so we know that neither is a $\noop$ and that their unpruned
% dependencies are from the ordering service.
% %
% By \invref{OrderingService}, either $I_b \in \deps{a}$ or $I_a \in \deps{b}$ or
% both. Without loss of generality, assume $I_b \in \deps{a}$. If $I_b$ is also
% in $\pruned(\deps{a})$, then we're done. Otherwise, $I_b$ has been pruned from
% $\deps{a}$. This happens only if $b$ is a $\noop$ or if $I_b$ has been chosen
% with $I_a \in \deps{b}$. $b$ is not a $\noop$, so $I_a \in \deps{b}$, and we're
% done.
%
% We'll see momentarily in \algoref{DeadlockBPaxos} that it's sometimes necessary
% for a BPaxos node to know the sets $\Pnoop{-}$ and $\Pnotnoop{-}$ that have
% been pruned from an ordering service response. Thus, BPaxos nodes propose
% values of the form $(a, \pruned(\deps{a}), \Pnoop{a}, \Pnotnoop{a})$ to the
% consensus service (instead of just $(a, \pruned(\deps{a}))$) where $\Pnoop{a}$
% and $\Pnotnoop{a}$ were the instances pruned from $\deps{a}$ to get
% $\pruned(\deps{a})$. That is, $\pruned(\deps{a}) = \deps{a} - (\Pnoop{a} \cup
% \Pnotnoop{a})$. Note that when an ordering service node $o_j$ proposes value
% $(a, \deps{a})$ to its colocated Fast Paxos acceptor, it actually proposes
% value $(a, \deps{a}, \emptyset, \emptyset)$.

%
% Now, we walk through \algoref{DeadlockBPaxos} for a Deadlock BPaxos node $S$
% recovering instance $R.i$. If there does not exist a value $v \in V$ with at
% least $\QuorumMajoritySize$ votes from acceptors in $\quorum$, then no value
% could have been chosen in round $0$, so $S$ is free to propose anything, so
% long as it satisfies \invref{PrunedDependencies}.
%
% Otherwise, there is some $(a, \deps{a}, \emptyset, \emptyset)$ that was voted
% by a majority of $\quorum$. We know that $\deps{a}$ is unpruned and that
% $\Pnoop{a} = \Pnotnoop{a} = \emptyset$ because this value was proposed by an
% ordering service node in round $0$.
% %
% As we saw with the incorrect BPaxos variant in \secref{IncorrectBPaxos}, we
% cannot blindly propose $(a, \deps{a})$ because it's possible that $\deps{a}$ is
% not a response from the ordering service.  Thus, $S$ has to do a bit of
% detective work to determine either that $\deps{a}$ is indeed a response from
% the ordering service or that $(a, \deps{a}, \emptyset, \emptyset)$ was
% definitely not chosen.
%
% First, $S$ sends $(R.i, a)$ to every ordering service node in $\quorum$ and
% gathers the union of their responses, $\deps{a}'$. Note that these requests can
% be piggybacked on the phase 1a messages previously sent by $S$ to eliminate the
% extra round trip. A majority of the acceptors in $\quorum$ voted for
% $\deps{a}$, and $\deps{a}'$ is a union of these responses (and the responses
% from the other acceptors in $\quorum$), so $\deps{a}'$ is either equal to
% $\deps{a}$ or a superset of $\deps{a}$.
%
% Next, $S$ then enters a for loop in an attempt to prune $\deps{a}'$ until it's
% either equal to $\deps{a}$ or until it determines that $\deps{a}$ could not
% have been chosen in the first place.
% %
% For every, $I_b \in \deps{a}' - \deps{a}$, $S$ first gets $I_b$ committed if it
% isn't already. To commit $I_b$, $S$ simply begins the recovery process for
% $I_b$. If $I_b$ is a $\noop$ or if $R.i \in \pruned(\deps{b})$, then we can
% prune $I_b$ and move on to the next $I_b$. Otherwise, $I_b$ is not a $\noop$
% and is committed without $R.i \in \pruned(\deps{b})$. Now, $\pruned(\deps{b})$
% is a (possibly) pruned response from the ordering service. Let the
% corresponding unpruned dependencies be $\deps{b}$. We perform a case analysis
% on whether $R.i \in \deps{b}$.
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item \textbf{Case $R.i \notin \deps{b}$.}
%     If $R.i \notin \deps{b}$ (equivalently $R.i \notin \Pnotnoop{b}$), then
%     there is some quorum of ordering service nodes that processed $I_b$ before
%     $R.i$. Then, it is impossible for there to be a superquorum of nodes that
%     processed $R.i$ before $I_b$. Thus, $\deps{a}$ cannot have been chosen on
%     the fast path in round $0$. In this case, we are free to propose anything.
%
%   \item \textbf{Case $R.i \in \deps{b}$.}
%     If $R.i \in \deps{b}$ (equivalently $R.i \in \Pnotnoop{b}$), then it has
%     been pruned from $\deps{b}$. Thus, either $R.i$ has been committed as a
%     $\noop$ or $R.i$ has been committed with $I_b$ in the pruned dependencies
%     of $I_a$. In either case, $R.i$ has already been committed, so we abort
%     recovery for $R.i$.
% \end{itemize}
%
% Finally, if $S$ exits the for loop, then it has pruned $\deps{a}'$ into
% $\deps{a}$ and can now propose it.
%
% \paragraph{Correctness}
% Deadlock BPaxos satisfies \invref{GadgetsChosen} by using Fast Paxos. It
% satisfies \invref{ConflictingGadgets} by satisfying
% \invref{PrunedDependencies}. It satisfies \invref{PrunedDependencies} because
% every proposal issued in \algoref{DeadlockBPaxos} is a proposal for $\noop$ or
% a pruned response from the ordering service.
%
% \paragraph{Deadlock}
% While Deadlock BPaxos is correct, as its name suggests, it is not very live.
% There are certain situations in which BPaxos can permanently deadlock. The
% reason for this is as follows. When a Deadlock BPaxos node $S$ recovers
% instance $I_a$, it may have to first recover instance $I_b$. When $S$ recovers
% instance $I_b$, it may have to recover $I_c$. And, when $S$ recovers $I_c$, it
% may have to recover $I_a$! At this point $S$ is deadlocked.
%
% More concretely, consider a Deadlock BPaxos deployment with $9$ nodes ($f =
% 4$). Imagine $4$ of these nodes have failed. The state of the remaining
% ordering service nodes are shown in \figref{DeadlockBPaxosExample}. All five
% ordering service nodes have processed five events $0$ through $4$ in instances
% $I_0$ through $I_4$. Every command $i$ conflicts with $i - 1 \bmod 5$ and $i +
% 1 \bmod 5$. For example, $0$ conflicts with $4$ and $1$. Ordering service node
% $o_1$ has seen the five commands in the order $0, 1, 2, 3, 4$, ordering service
% node $o_2$ has seen the five commands in the order $1, 2, 3, 4, 0$, and so on.
%
% {\input{figures/deadlock_bpaxos_example.tex}}
%
% Imagine BPaxos node $S$ attempts to recover $I_0$. $\QuorumMajoritySize$
% acceptors have voted for $\deps{0} = \set{4}$, but $o_2$ voted for $\set{1,
% 4}$. Thus, $S$ attempts to recover $I_1$. $\QuorumMajoritySize$ acceptors have
% voted for $\deps{1} = \set{0}$, but $o_3$ voted for $\set{0, 2}$, so $S$
% attempts to recover $I_2$. This continues until $S$ attempts to recover $I_4$.
% $\QuorumMajoritySize$ acceptors have voted for $\deps{4} = \set{3}$, but $o_1$
% voted for $\set{0, 3}$, so $S$ attempts to recover $I_0$. This is a deadlock.
%
% Moreover, based on the order in which the $4$ failed nodes processed the five
% commands, any four of the five commands could have been chosen. For example, if
% the four failed nodes saw the commands in the order $0, 1, 2, 3, 4$, then the
% commands $1, 2, 3, 4$ could have been committed on the fast path in round 0.
% Or, if the four failed nodes saw the commands in the order $1, 2, 3, 4, 0$,
% then the commands $2, 3, 4, 0$ could have been committed on the fast path in
% round 0. Because these four nodes have failed, it is impossible for us to know
% the order in which they processed the five commands, so it is impossible for us
% to know which subset of the commands may have been committed. This shows that
% there is no simple fix to \algoref{DeadlockBPaxos} that would allow a Deadlock
% BPaxos node to resolve the deadlock.
%
% \TODO[mwhittaker]{%
%   There is still one small annoying detail not fully explained in this section.
%   It might be possible that in the last else case of \algoref{DeadlockBPaxos},
%   a node learns that $R.i$ has already been chosen, but it doesn't know what
%   dependencies it has been chosen with. I think that this is actually
%   impossible, but I'm not 100\% sure. To be super duper sure that it is
%   impossible, we just have to make sure that whenever a node learns that an
%   instance has been chosen, it also learns the value that was chosen. This is
%   not at all hard to do, but it makes the protocol a little bit more
%   cumbersome.
