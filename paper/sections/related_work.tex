\condensedparagraph{Egalitarian Paxos}
Many of the core ideas behind BPaxos were taken directly from Egalitarian Paxos
(EPaxos)~\cite{moraru2013there, moraru2013proof}. For example, EPaxos and the
BPaxos protocols both construct directed graphs of commands and execute
commands in reverse topological order, one strongly connected component at a
time. However, EPaxos and the BPaxos protocols also have a number of
fundamental differences (e.g., BPaxos is more modular and has optimal commit
latency). See \appendixref{EPaxosAndBPaxos} for a more detailed comparison.

\condensedparagraph{A Family of Leaderless Generalized Consensus Algorithms}
In~\cite{losa2016brief}, Losa et al.\ propose a generic generalized consensus
algorithm that is structured as the composition of a generic dependency-set
algorithm and a generic map-agreement algorithm. The invariants of the
dependency-set and map-agreement algorithm are essentially identical to
\invref{ConflictInvariant} and \invref{ConsensusInvariant}, and the example
implementations of these two algorithms in~\cite{losa2016brief} form an
algorithm similar to Simple BPaxos. Our paper builds on this body of work by
introducing Incorrect BPaxos, Unanimous BPaxos, Deadlock BPaxos, and Majority
Commit BPaxos.

\condensedparagraph{Caesar}
Caesar~\cite{arun2017speeding} is very similar to EPaxos and Majority Commit
BPaxos, but Caesar allows a command to be chosen on the fast path even if there
does \emph{not} exist a fast quorum of nodes that agree on the command's
dependencies. Instead, Caesar assigns timestamps to commands and only requires
that a fast quorum of nodes agree on a command's timestamp. Doing so, Caesar
implements generalized consensus without maintaining
\invref{ConsensusInvariant}. This makes the protocol more challenging to
understand.

\condensedparagraph{Generalized Paxos}
Generalized Paxos~\cite{lamport2005generalized} exploits the commutativity of
state machine commands to reduce the number of conflicts that arise in
non-generalized consensus algorithms. However, when a collision occurs, a
distinguished leader is responsible for arbitrating collision recovery. The
Bipartisan protocols do not depend on a leader for normal case processing or
collision recovery.

\condensedparagraph{Complementary Paxos Variants}
S-Paxos~\cite{biely2012s} is a Paxos variant that decouples control flow from
data flow. Flexible Paxos~\cite{howard2016flexible} is a Paxos variant that
allows for flexible and dynamic quorum sizes. Speculative
Paxos~\cite{ports2015designing} is a Paxos variant in which replicas
speculatively execute state machine commands before they are known to be
chosen. We believe that the BPaxos protocols could benefit from ideas in all
three papers.
