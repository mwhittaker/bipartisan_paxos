\section{Unanimous BPaxos}\seclabel{UnanimousBPaxos}
\defword{Unanimous BPaxos} is identical to Unsafe BPaxos except for the
following small modifications.  First, we increase the fast quorum size from
$\SuperQuorumSize$ to $2f + 1$. Thus, choosing a value in round $0$ requires a
unanimous vote. Second, we implement Unanimous BPaxos with the Fast Paxos
tweak shown in \algoref{FastPaxosTweak} in \appendixref{FastPaxos} where value
$v$ in \lineref{FastPaxosTweakCase3} may have been chosen in round $0$ only if
every acceptor in $\Quorum$ voted for $v$ in round $0$. Like Unsafe BPaxos,
Unanimous BPaxos can choose a command in one round trip (in the best case), but
unlike Unsafe BPaxos, Unanimous BPaxos is safe.
%
Unanimous BPaxos maintains \invref{ConsensusInvariant} trivially by using Fast
Paxos, and like Simple BPaxos, Unanimous BPaxos maintains
\invref{ConflictInvariant} by maintaining \invref{SimpleBpaxosInvariant} (see
\appendixref{UnanimousBPaxosProof} for proof).
%
Intuitively, increasing the fast quorum size from $\SuperQuorumSize$ to $2f +
1$ resolves the tension between maintaining \invref{ConsensusInvariant} and
\invref{ConflictInvariant} by eliminating the scenarios in which a BPaxos node
$b_i$ is simultaneously forced to propose a value $v$ to maintain
\invref{ConsensusInvariant} and forced \emph{not} to propose $v$ to maintain
\invref{ConflictInvariant}. In particular, whenever a Unanimous BPaxos node
$b_i$ is forced to propose a value $v = (x, \deps{I_x})$ on
\lineref{FastPaxosTweakCase2Code} or \lineref{FastPaxosTweakCase3Code} of
\algoref{FastPaxosTweak}, the large fast quorum sizes guarantee that $\deps{I}$
was computed by the dependency service.
