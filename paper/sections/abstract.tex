\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we present Bipartisan Paxos: a family of asynchronous
generalized consensus protocols that achieve low latency, high throughput, and
simplicity. The Bipartisan Paxos protocols can commit a command in two network
delays (the theoretical minimum), achieving low latency. They do not depend on
a distinguished leader for normal processing or conflict resolution, achieving
high throughput. And, they are designed with modularity and incrementality in
mind, achieving simplicity.
