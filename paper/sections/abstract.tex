Consensus is a fundamental problem in distributed systems. It sits at the heart
of numerous distributed system deployed in industry, and it has been the
subject of theoretical scrutiny for decades. Despite the attention, there is no
asynchronous consensus algorithm that achieves the holy grail of high
throughput and optimal commit latency while remaining understandable by mere
mortals.
%
In this paper, we present Bipartisan Paxos: a family of asynchronous
generalized consensus protocols that achieve low latency, high throughput, and
simplicity. The Bipartisan Paxos protocols can commit a command in two network
delays (the theoretical minimum), achieving low latency. They do not depend on
a distinguished leader for normal processing or conflict resolution, achieving
high throughput. And, they are designed with modularity and incrementality in
mind, achieving simplicity.
