\begin{abstract}
  Egalitarian Paxos~\cite{moraru2013there}, or EPaxos, is a state machine
  replication protocol like Raft~\cite{ongaro2014search} or Viewstamped
  Replication~\cite{liskov2012viewstamped}. EPaxos has a number of nice features
  that set it apart from other state machine replication protocols. For example,
  it can choose non-conflicting commands in one round trip, disjoint sets of
  conflicting commands do not affect each other, and superquorum sizes are one
  node smaller than the superquorum sizes used by other protocols.

  In this paper, we describe a family of consensus algorithms that are derived
  from EPaxos. We call them Bipartisan Paxos, Unanimous Bipartisan Paxos, and
  Fast Bipartisan Paxos.
