\section{Majority Commit BPaxos}
\TODO[mwhittaker]{%
  Complete this section. In short, Majority Commit BPaxos fixes the deadlock
  issues that Deadlock BPaxos has.
}
\TODO[mwhittaker]{%
  Check if EPaxos is susceptible to the deadlock issues that Deadlock BPaxos
  has. The EPaxos proof of deadlock freedom seems like it might have a bug in
  it.
}

\TODO[mwhittaker]{%
  Explain that Unanimous BPaxos, Deadlock BPaxos, and Majority Commit BPaxos
  can be "fast" in the sense of Fast Paxos. Clients can initiate the protocol.
  They don't have to send to a command leader first. The one wrinkle is that a
  client will have to randomly pick a leader for the instance, say $R$, and
  send the command in some fresh instance owned by $R$. These fresh instances
  have to be default initialized in the any state, but this doesn't affect the
  correctness of anything.
}

\TODO[mwhittaker]{%
  Explain how EPaxos gets quorum sizes one smaller. Explain why EPaxos cannot
  be "fast" and why that affects the protocol in non-trivial ways.
}

\TODO[mwhittaker]{%
  Think about a Caesar variant of BPaxos. BPaxos may not satisfy the two main
  invariants. It seems like they don't run consensus on edges, only on
  commands?
