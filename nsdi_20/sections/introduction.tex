\begin{itemize}
  \item Introduction

  \item Background
    \begin{itemize}
      \item MultiPaxos
    \end{itemize}

  \item Bipartisan Paxos
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Main idea overview
      \item Protocol overview with figure
      \item Dependency service
      \item Consensus Service
      \item Replicas
      \item BPaxos Nodes
      \item Example
      \item Full pseudo-code
      \item Recovery
    \end{itemize}

  \item Scaling
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Other protocols tightly coupled
      \item Our protocol decoupled, already gives boost
      \item Bottleneck analysis
      \item Scale to eliminate bottleneck
    \end{itemize}

  \item Garbage Collection
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Leaders
      \item Acceptors and Proposers
      \item Dependency service, new dep service properties
      \item Replica
    \end{itemize}

  \item Practical Considerations
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Client table
      \item Dependency compaction
      \item
    \end{itemize}

  \item Evaluation
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        latency throughput of protocol in lan vs epaxos and paxos (for various
        params)
      \item
        same graph as above without decoupling and without scaling to show
        effects
      \item
        latency throughput of protocols in lan with batching
      \item
        graphs to show garbage collection effects on throughput (makes it
        jittery), memory usage over time with projection on how long before
        running out.
      \item
        latency throughput of protocol in WAN to show that it's actually not
        great
    \end{itemize}

      \item SPaxos (decoupling)
      \item Multithreaded paxos (essentially decoupling)
      \item all other papers on gc
