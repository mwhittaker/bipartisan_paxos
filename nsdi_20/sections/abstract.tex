  There is no shortage of state machine replication protocols. From Generalized
  Paxos to EPaxos, a huge number replication protocols have been proposed that
  achieve high throughput \emph{and} low latency. However, these protocols all
  have two problems. First, they are too complicated. This is not a secret;
  state machine replication is notoriously difficult to understand. Second,
  they don't scale. Many protocols actually slow down when you scale them,
  instead of speeding up. For example, increasing the number of MultiPaxos
  acceptors increases quorum sizes and slows down the protocol.

  In this paper, we tackle both problems with a single solution: modularity. We
  present Bipartisan Paxos (BPaxos), a \emph{modular} state machine replication
  protocol. Modularity yields simplicity. BPaxos is divided into a number of
  independent modules that can be understood and proven correct in isolation.
  Modularity also yields high throughput via scaling. We note that while many
  replication protocol components do not scale, some do. By modularizing
  BPaxos, we are able to disentangle the components that don't scale from those
  that do. Scaling the bottleneck components increases the protocol's
  throughput.
