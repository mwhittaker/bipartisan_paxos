  There is no shortage of state machine replication protocols. From Generalized
  Paxos to EPaxos, a huge number of replication protocols have been proposed
  that achieve high throughput \emph{and} low latency. However, these protocols
  all have two problems. First, they don't scale. Many protocols actually slow
  down when you scale them, instead of speeding up. For example, increasing the
  number of MultiPaxos acceptors increases quorum sizes and slows down the
  protocol. Second, they are too complicated. This is not a secret; state
  machine replication is notoriously difficult to understand.

  In this paper, we tackle both problems with a single solution:
  \emph{modularity}. We present Bipartisan Paxos (BPaxos), a modular state
  machine replication protocol. Modularity yields high throughput via scaling.
  We note that while many replication protocol components do not scale, some
  do. By modularizing BPaxos, we are able to disentangle the two and scale the
  bottleneck components to increase the protocol's throughput. Modularity also
  yields simplicity. BPaxos is divided into a number of independent modules
  that can be understood and proven correct in isolation.
